There is also an updated release of SphinxTrain, and the [acoustic
modeling tutorial](/wiki/tutorialam) has been updated to reflect the
new and simplified usage.  Still working on the other tutorials, sorry.

To quote the release notes, this release fixes a few long-standing
bugs in SphinxTrain and makes the package (hopefully) easier to use.
Among other things:

- The dependency on SphinxBase is gone, because SphinxBase is gone
- The dependency on Sphinx3 for VTLN and force-alignment is gone (`sphinx3_align` is included)
- Multi-CPU training actually works, tested on up to 64 CPUs with LibriSpeech, much easier than setting up PBS on the Clown
- The dependency on Visual Studio for buliding on Windows is gone (but *please* just use WSL, *please*)
- The dependency on Autotools is gone (CMake ain't great but it's much less bad)
- There is a Dockerfile now
- There is "continuous integration" now (sort of)
- The `-remove_silence` option has been disabled by default (unlike in PocketSphinx you can still turn it on if you really want to, it might save you a bit of time in training)
- It is not necessary to install SphinxTrain system-wide to run training
- G2P support has been updated for the most commonly installed version of OpenFST (do not try to use any other version, because C++, that's why)
