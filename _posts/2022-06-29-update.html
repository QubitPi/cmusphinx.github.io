<p>
  Thank you to all of the contributors who have keept CMUSphinx alive
  over the last decade, in particular to Nickolay Shmyrev and the
  whole team at Alpha Cephei.  As you may have noticed, active
  development has mostly ceased over the last few years, and the
  technological foundation of CMUSphinx has become quite antiquated.
</p>
<p>
  For state-of-the-art speech recognition the Alpha Cephei team is now
  working exclusively
  on <a href="https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api">Vosk</a>, and
  there are a number of other open source options,
  notably <a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai">Coqui</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec">wav2vec</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/julius-speech/julius">Julius</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR">TensorFlowASR</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">DeepSpeech</a> and
  of course <a href="https://kaldi-asr.org/">Kaldi</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Nonetheless, there are still many people using CMUSphinx and
  PocketSphinx in particular, so there is some value in maintaining
  (if not actually developing) it.  Its users frequently
  encounter difficulties due to the build system, which could be
  corrected by modernizing the codebase slightly.  Due to the eternal
  "pre-alpha" status of the system, there are also many problems of
  portability and stability that should be adressed.
</p>
<p>
  For this reason, we are preparing a true release of PocketSphinx,
  with a focus on a modern build system with no external dependencies,
  and a stable, documented, and easy to use API in C and Python.  In
  addition, SphinxTrain will either continue to be maintained or will
  simply be integrated into PocketSphinx.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, SourceForge is no longer a viable option for hosting.  From
  now on, the <a href="http://github.com/cmusphinx">GitHub Project</a>
  is the official home of CMUSphinx, and we will soon migrate all the
  other downloads (models, etc) and close the SourceForge site.
