## Software

The CMU Sphinx toolkit has been around for quite some time, and has
produced a large number of packages and libraries.  At the moment,
only these are currently being maintained:

  * PocketSphinx — recognizer library written in C.
  * SphinxTrain — acoustic model training tools

We recommend you use the current development code:

* [pocketsphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx)
* [sphinxtrain](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxtrain)

We do not maintain distribution-specific packages yet, but help to
update them is truly appreciated. Some GNU/Linux distributions already
include CMUSphinx packages.


## Models

CMUSphinx assumes that you use the statistical models which describe
language.  There are many models trained for various acoustic
conditions and various performance requirements. We collect the best
models available at our download page. We hope you'll be able to find
the best model for your language there:

(note: we will be moving away from SourceForge soon).
